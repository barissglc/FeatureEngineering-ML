# FeatureEngineering-ML
Developed under the Milli Teknoloji Akademisi AI Expertise Program, this project covers time series analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling. It employs algorithms (tsfresh, XGBoost, CatBoost, StackingClassifier) and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, with performance evaluated using metrics.
