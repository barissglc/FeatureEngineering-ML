## ðŸ“Š Methods Applied
Below are the details of the methods applied in this project:

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Filling in missing values and cleaning unnecessary columns.
- Applying Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- Scaling features using StandardScaler.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Extracting time series features with the **tsfresh** library.
- Reducing dimensionality using **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**.
- Selecting the most important features using the **SelectKBest** method.

### **3. Modeling**
- **RandomForestClassifier**: Used especially to handle imbalanced data.
- **XGBoost & CatBoost**: Two of the best gradient boosting models were employed.
- **StackingClassifier**: Combined different models to achieve more robust predictions.

### **4. Model Optimization**
- Determining the best hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.
- Balancing the data with **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**.

### **5. Model Performance and Evaluation**
- Analyzing model predictions with a **Confusion Matrix**.
- Comparing model performance using metrics such as **ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and F1 Score**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Conclusions
- **StackingClassifier** achieved higher accuracy and F1 scores compared to individual models.
- The use of **PCA** reduced model performance by causing the loss of important features.
- Features extracted with **tsfresh** significantly enhanced the model's predictive power.
- The **ADASYN method** facilitated more successful predictions on imbalanced datasets.
